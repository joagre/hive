The review has this to say:

D) Scheduler “wait_for_completions()” needs semantics

What does it do on Linux vs FreeRTOS?

Does it block the whole runtime thread/task?

Does it poll? If it blocks, how do you handle newly spawned actors or messages sent from other threads?

If completions come from multiple producers (net task, file task, timer task), your SPSC queues are fine individually, but you need a “wait on any queue” mechanism. That tends to become an eventfd/condvar/queue-set. The spec should name it.

Right now it’s hand-wavy.

Comments on that?

CLAUDE.md still mentions "Distributed actors for multi-MCU systems" and "Hot code reload"
