E) Cross-thread API calls are not specified

On FreeRTOS you have I/O tasks. On Linux you have I/O threads. Do they call into runtime functions directly? Probably not, but the spec should say:

Only the scheduler thread may mutate actor/mailbox/bus state.

I/O threads/tasks can only push completion entries to SPSC queues.

Also: can an external thread call rt_ipc_send() into an actor mailbox? Your spec implies “actors yield explicitly,” but it does not define multi-threaded senders. If you allow it, your “no surprises” story gets harder. If you forbid it, state it.
