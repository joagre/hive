1) Mailbox capacity and backpressure

You have a mailbox entry pool and message data pool, but mailbox semantics are underspecified:

Is there a per-actor mailbox capacity, or just global pool exhaustion?

When receiver mailbox is full:

COPY: does send fail NOMEM, or block, or drop oldest?

BORROW: you already block, but do you block waiting for mailbox entry availability or waiting for receiver consumption?

For embedded, you want explicit, testable behavior. Otherwise you get “it depends on pool pressure.”
