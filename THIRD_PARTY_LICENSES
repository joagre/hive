## Summary

| Directory | Type | License | Source |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| `CMSIS/Include/` | Unmodified | Apache-2.0 | ARM CMSIS-Core |
| `CMSIS/STM32F4xx/` | Unmodified | BSD-3-Clause | STMicroelectronics |
| `STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Driver/` | Unmodified | ST Liberty | STMicroelectronics |
| `bosch/` | Bitcraze-modified | BSD-3-Clause | Bitcraze crazyflie-firmware |
| `st/vl53l1x/` | **C port** | BSD-3-Clause | ST Arduino library |
| `bitcraze/pmw3901/` | **C port** | MIT | Bitcraze Arduino library |

**Bosch drivers** - The Bosch sensor drivers (BMI088, BMP3, etc.) are from the Bitcraze
crazyflie-firmware repository, which uses modified versions of the Bosch SensorAPI.

**C ports** - The VL53L1x and PMW3901 drivers are C ports of the original C++/Arduino
libraries. The C ports implement the same register-level logic but use plain C with
platform I2C/SPI callbacks instead of Arduino Wire/SPI classes.
